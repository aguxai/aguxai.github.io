Since you're a new player, i suggest that you can spend your time to learn dota 2 by articles published by purge r if you curious about the gameplay you can practice with bot, by clicked at Learn on dota 2 board at your game. Sure, your skill
will be upgraded by got practice, practice, and practice. At this paper i will teach you about basic and become a good player and
got commended, doesn't matter if you're a newcoming player, if you play good the team will commended you.

**The Team**

On Dota 2, the gamepla are divided by 2 faction, the dire and the radiant. You can be a in the dire or in radiant and you cannt manually
select your faction because at the hero picking you will be get randomed faction.

**Roles**

In dota 2, basically are divided by 2 roles i.e core and support. Its up to you to pick hero, my advice you can be a first pick to
hard carry, and if you're on last pick, see your teammates, if they already pick support you can pick sup too or you can pick late
game hero like a chaos knight. Attention!! carefull about hero you're pick, if you pick hero like a meepo, invoker, or powerfull
hero in all gameplay or high dps and high xpm you can be a countered if you pick at early pick, like a meepo will be countered by a
enemy by picking a lich, or winter wyvern, the ultimate at this hero are pwoerfull to countered meepo, and instantly death.

**Lanes**

This is a the important at gameplay on Dota 2, you must know about your lanes before playing dota 2, if you didnt know you can
play like a kid, roaming and didnt get any xp or gold, this is make me laugh, lol. At Dota 2 lanes are divided by 3, i.e Top, Mid, and
Bottom. You can know your lanes by selected you guide on this game at hero your pick, i.e Phantom Assasin, Mid and Safelane, if mid
already selected by a mid hero like a invoker you can change your lanes to safelane.

**Strategy**

Dota 2 is moba, moba need a strategy to win, the strategy is basically fast push fast win, not many kill fast win. If you're a focus
on killing enemy and didnt push and farming again, you can lose, trust me. If you're a newcoming use this strategy you can win,
except the enemy is pro because they're make new account and they selected im beginner to dota 2, they can got rampage if they can
got godlike in early. 

**Matchmaking**

They algorithm of Dota 2 matchmaking is complex, and i didnt commented on this, the matchmaking on dota 2 is good because on this
update at 7.x. x to welcoming new player you can select at a easy hero to play, like juggernaut, phantom assasin. Good work valve.

**The Item**

Please dude if you're not know about item usability, the item you're chose will not affected to your hero, like a you pick a
mele hero and on the skill talent already had a lifesteal and you use a vladimir offering and this item will affect you to 
get a lifesteal, this item will be not recomended because you already have this. You can get a item affected your damage.

**Teamwork**

Dota 2 need teamwork to win, and need a support, if your team all carry, you can lose because if you doesnt have support who
can warding? and be a initiator? warding is important to win the game, because you can ganking.

**The Final Word**

Welcome to Dota 2!! Dude.
